# support-vector-regression
Boston dataset is a dataset present in sklearn datasets.
In this notebook support vector regression model using linear and rbf kernel is created and then further played with different values of c(which isinversly proportional to strength of regularisation) and gamma (which inversly proportional to square of sigma) with the help of GridSearchCV present in sklearn model selection.
